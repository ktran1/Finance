This is my personal notes for maths finance. For organization :

&emsp; The first chapter represents basic concepts and knowledges in finance.

&emsp; The second chapter represents fondamentally what is probability and its related concepts. We find here the convergence of random variables, uniform integrability, Radon-Nikodym theorem and the three major theorems : monotone convergence theorem, dominated convergence theorem and Fatou's lemma. In section useful tools,  important equalities and inequalities are found.      

&emsp; The third chapter is about statistic which is for usual distributions, hypothesis tests, estimators such as MLE, OLS, GMM, IV and their properties. 

&emsp; The fourth chapter is for stochastic processes and their properties (stationary, ergodicity). We find here popular processes such as Gaussian, Poisson, Markov, Brownian motion, Ornstein Uhlenbeck, martingale, cadlag. For stochastic integrals, one describes the indispensable Ito lemma and infinitesimal generator. For application in finance, Giranov's theorem is used to switch between physical measure and risk neutral measure. 

&emsp; The fifth chapter is for optimization or optimal control. In deterministic case, we find Euler-Lagrange, Pontryagin's maximum principle, Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and the well-known Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model. In stochastic case, we find Kalman filter, Linear quadratic gaussian control. We also find here the finite difference method (FDM) and finite element method (FEM), which are powerful for solving partial differential equation (PDE) in HJB. Finally, we find the Merton's portfolio problem and the optimal stopping. 

&emsp; The sixth chapter is about quantitative : classical decomposition ETS (error, trend, seasonality), ARIMA model, pairs trading (cointegration \& correlation), modern portfolio theory, asset price simulation by GBM, option pricing (Black-Scholes model and binomial options pricing model), Greeks, delta heding, Kelly criterion, utility, risk aversion and technical analysis by well-known indicators.
