This is my personal notes written in latex (not finished yet) for maths finance that I have started at the end of 2022. For organization :

&ensp; The first chapter represents basic concepts and knowledges in finance.

\tThe second chapter represents fondamentally what is probability and its related concepts, tools ... We find here also the convergence of random variables, uniform integrability, which are necessary in chapter stochastic process.

\tThe third chapter is about statistics which is mainly for hypothesis tests

\tThe fourth chapter is for stochastic process, which describes some famous processes (Gaussian, Poisson, Markov) and then martingale, cadlag process.

\tThe fifth chapter is for stochastic calculus with Ito lemma ...

\tThe sixth chapter is about quantitative (Black-Scholes model, binomial options pricing model,...

\tThe seventh chapter is for technical analysis method by well-known indicators.

\tThe eighth and ninth chapter is for optimal control, respectively deterministic and stochastic, which are important tools for portfolio optimization. We find here also the well-known Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model. 

\tThe tenth chapter is for Menton's portfolio problem.

\tThe eleventh is about finite difference method and finite element method.
